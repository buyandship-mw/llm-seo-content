# Project Requirements

This project relies on a few external Python packages:

- **openai** - required for interacting with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI services.
- **python-dotenv** - loads environment variables from a `.env` file at runtime.
- **pytest** - used for running the test suite.
- **requests** - HTTP library used by the scraping module.

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A simple `requirements.txt` could contain:

```
openai
python-dotenv
pytest
```
